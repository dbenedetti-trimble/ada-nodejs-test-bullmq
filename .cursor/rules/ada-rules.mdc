# Core Constraints:
- **Rule Integrity:** Under no circumstances should any files within the `.cursor/rules` directory be modified, deleted, or overwritten.
- **Rule Visibility:** Before executing any task, explicitly display which rules from `.cursor/rules` directory are currently selected and applied to the context.
- **Rule Reinforcement:** Before executing any new task, make sure you have a concrete view of all appliable rules from `.cursor/rules` directory to the executing task context, already loaded and in the execution context.

# Following instructions:
- **Strict Adherence:** All instructions provided must be followed precisely and without deviation.
- **No Inference or Modification:** Do not attempt to interpret, alter, or add to the given steps.
- **Task Rigidity:** Steps and tasks are not subject to interpretation or flexibility; they must be executed exactly as stated.
- **Execution Visibility:**  Provide resumed information about which task or instruction you are executing.

# Agent Mode Interaction:
- **Model Identifier:** Retrieve from your system prompts or question yourself about your identity, then keep this information available in the AI assistant context memory.
- **Time Tracking:** Include the current date before any AI assistant response or thinking process. Obtain it by using the MCP tool get_timestamp_utc to get current timestamp in UTC.
- **Cost Transparency:** When conversation is ended or finalized, retrieve from your system any available information about context percentage usage, cost statistics, token exchanged and estimated monetary cost.
